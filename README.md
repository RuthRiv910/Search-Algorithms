# Search-Algorithms
This Python lab implements four search algorithms to find the best or optimal path between two locations using real time and heuristic traffic data such as the following: 
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Depth-First Search (DFS)
Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
A* Search

# Language 
Python 
No external softwares, hardwares, or libraries required

# How to Implement

Do not include input.txt or output.txt in your repository 

All input is case-sensitive

The start and goal states may be the same

Use Python

Download the source files

Place your input.txt file in the directory

Input  script: python3 search_pathfinder.py

Input must include:

<...ALGO...>

<...START STATE...>
  
<...GOAL STATE...>
  
<...NUMBER OF LIVE TRAFFIC LINES...>
  
<... LIVE TRAFFIC LINES ...>

<...NUMBER OF SUNDAY TRAFFIC LINES...>
  
<... SUNDAY TRAFFIC LINES ...>

Results outputted in output.txt
